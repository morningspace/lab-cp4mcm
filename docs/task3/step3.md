# Task 3 - Step 3: Track progress until the import is finished

  Instructions
  ============

  During the import process, you can track the progress by monitoring the pods status under a namespace called
  multicluster-endpoint on the cluster being imported. When all pods are up and running, the import process is
  finished.

  You can also go to CP4MCM UI via below link to check the cluster status:
  $CP4MCM_BASE_URL/multicloud/clusters
