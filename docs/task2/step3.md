# Task 2 - Step 3: Track progress until the provission is finished

  Instructions
  ============

  During the provision, you can track the progress either on hub cluster or on AWS.

  1) On hub cluster, you can monitor the logs of the pod created for the provision job.
  2) On AWS, go to the link: https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation. From the "Stacks" page, choose the
     right stack by the cluster name being used to provision your cluster, then go to its "Events" tab to find
     the progress.
