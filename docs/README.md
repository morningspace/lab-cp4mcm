  ============

  In this lab, I will walk you through the steps on how to use IBM CloudPak for Multicloud Management (CP4MCM)

  sample application from hub cluster to the two managed clusters, to give you a better view of how CP4MCM can
  manage clusters and applications in a hybrid environment.

  Tasks:

  0) Prepare environment
  1) Configure hub cluster to be publicly accessible
  2) Manage a cluster provisoned by AWS EKS
  3) Manage a cluster provisoned by kind
