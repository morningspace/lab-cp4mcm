# IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management: All-in-One Playground to Manage Your Hybrid Cloud

Introduction
============

This lab will walk you through the steps to use IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management (CP4MCM) to manage a
local cluster which is provisioned using kind, and a remote cluster which is provisioned using AWS EKS, then
deploy a sample application from hub cluster to managed clusters. This gives you a better view of how CP4MCM
can manage clusters and applications in a hybrid environment efficiently.

This lab will also demonstrate how to use IBM Cloud Secure Gateway to establish a secured connection between
hub cluster deployed in private network and managed cluster deployed on internet.
