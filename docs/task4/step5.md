# Task 4 - Step 5: Check results

Instructions
============

After we define applications, channels, subscriptions properly, newly created deployable will be deployed on
to the managed clusters from the hub cluster through the channel, subscription mechanism. Usually, it takes
a few minutes to take effect.

You can check the results by issuing oc command both on hub cluster and managed clusters.
