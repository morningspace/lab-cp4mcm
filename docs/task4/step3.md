# Task 4 - Step 3: Define and apply a subscription

  Instructions
  ============

  Subscription can point to a channel for identifying new and updated Kubernetes resources for deployment.

  As an example, in this lab, we will define subscription that matches the application and channel we defined.
  It also defines where we want the applications to be deployed.
