# Task 4 - Step 1: Define and apply an application

  Instructions
  ============

  CP4MCM provides enhanced application management capabilities through a Kubernetes resource based application
  model and channel/subscription based deployment options. Applications are composed of multiple resources and
  defined in YAML.

  As an example, in this lab, we will define nginx as an application and deploy it to managed clusters through
  the channel, subscription mechanism.

  In the application definition YAML, it includes "spec.componentKinds" to indicate that the application uses a 
  subscription, and "spec.selector" to define the labels used to match the application with the subscription.
