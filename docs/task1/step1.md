## Login to IBM Cloud using your IBM Cloud account

If you do not have IBM Cloud account yet, you can sign up by yourself to register a free account which should be sufficient for you to finish this lab.

Or, you can contact the lab owner for any help.

Then, log in to IBM Cloud: https://cloud.ibm.com/ using your account.

## Create a Secure Gateway resource

Go to https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog, search by using keywords "Secure Gateway", you can see a service called "Secure Gateway" listed in the search results.

Click this service and go to its details page, then click the "Create" button at the bottom. The resource will be created then.

## Add a gateway

On the "Secure Gateway Dashboard" page, click the plus icon to add a gateway.

Give your gateway a name, e.g. my-cp4mcm-gateway and leave all the other fields without change.

## Add a destination

On the "Secure Gateway Dashboard" page, click the gateway that we created just now, then click the plus icon to add a destination for your gateway.

Answer the questions on the dialog wizard with below suggested values one by one:

```
1) Where is your resource located? On-Premises
2) What is the host and port of your destination? 
   Resource Hostname: $HOSTNAME
   Resource Port: 8443
3) What protocol will the User/Application use to connect to your destination? TCP
4) What kind of authentication does your destination enforce? None
5) What would you like to name this destination? e.g. my-cp4mcm-destination
```

Here, $HOSTNAME is the host name of your host machine. You can get the value as below:

```shell
echo $HOSTNAME
```
