## CP4MCM UI shortcut

To explore CP4MCM UI, you can open the web browser by double clicking the Firefox icon on desktop, then find
a bookmark called "IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management" on Bookmarks Bar. Click the bookmark to open the
login page, use credential `admin/Passw0rd!` to login CP4MCM.

Note: you may need to click the bookmark again after login in order to bring you to the CP4MCM welcome page.

## Time consuming task

When you run [Task 2: Manage a cluster provisioned by AWS EKS](task2/), usually it will take a bit long time to finish
the cluster provision process on AWS. After you finish kicking off the provision, you can go to run the next
task [Task 3: Manage a cluster provisioned by kind](task3/), then go back and check the provision progress on AWS from
time to time until it is finished.
