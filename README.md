# All-in-One Playground to Manage Your Hybrid Cloud Using IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management

## About This Lab

* This lab will walk you through the steps to use IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management (CP4MCM) to manage a
cluster on your local machine and a remote cluster on AWS, then deploy a sample application from hub cluster
to the two managed clusters.

* After you finish up this lab, you will have a better view of how CP4MCM can manage clusters and applications
from hub cluster to multiple managed clusters which are two typical usage scenarios frequently being used by
CP4MCM users.

* In this lab, you will also learn how CP4MCM manages clusters efficiently in hybrid environment with the help
of IBM Cloud Secure Gateway.

## More On This Lab

This lab is designed to demonstrate all cool features that IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management provides. It
will continuously be updated to include more features. As an example, other than Kubernetes cluster, CP4MCM can 
also be used to manage VM by integrating with [Red Hat CloudForms](https://access.redhat.com/products/red-hat-cloudforms). If you are interested in this lab, welcome to 
watch it and give it a star, so that you will be notified for any new updates in future! Hope you enjoy it :-)
