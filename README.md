# All-in-One Playground to Manage Your Hybrid Cloud Using IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management

## About The Lab

* This lab will walk you through the steps to use IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management (CP4MCM) to manage a
cluster on your local machine and a remote cluster on AWS, then deploy a sample application from hub cluster
to the two managed clusters.

* After you finish up this lab, you will have a better view of how CP4MCM can manage clusters and applications
from hub cluster to multiple managed clusters which are two typical usage scenarios frequently being used by
CP4MCM users.

* In this lab, you will also learn how CP4MCM manages clusters efficiently in hybrid environment with the help
of IBM Cloud Secure Gateway.
