# Lab: All-in-One Playground to Manage Your Hybrid Cloud Using IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management

## Introduction

This lab will walk you through the steps to use IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management (CP4MCM) to manage a
cluster on your local machine and a remote cluster on AWS, then deploy a sample application from hub cluster
to the two managed clusters. This gives you a better view of how CP4MCM can manage clusters and applications
in a hybrid environment efficiently. See [lab instructions](docs/) for more details.
